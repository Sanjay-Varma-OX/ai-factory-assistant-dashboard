  "content": "Hi maintenance community,\n\nAs a Senior Maintenance Technician working with predictive maintenance systems, I've noticed recurring sensor-related challenges. Looking to compile common issues and solutions:\n\n1. False readings from vibration sensors\n2. Temperature sensor calibration drift\n3. Connectivity issues in harsh environments\n4. Data quality inconsistencies\n\nWhat sensor problems have you encountered, and how did you resolve them? Any preventive measures that worked well?",

Signal conditioning filters\n4. Redundant sensors for critical points\n\nReduced false readings by 85%. Key is preventive maintenance of the sensors themselves.",

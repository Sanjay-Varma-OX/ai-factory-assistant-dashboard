  "content": "Hi everyone, I'm looking to establish comprehensive KPIs for our maintenance team as we transition to AI-powered solutions. We want to measure both the technical and business impacts.\n\nKey areas we're considering:\n1. Equipment reliability metrics\n2. Maintenance team productivity\n3. Cost savings indicators\n4. AI prediction accuracy\n\nWhat KPIs have worked well in your organizations? How do you track and report them effectively?",

      "content": "Great question, Sarah! Here are the key KPIs we've found most valuable:\n\n- Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) - increased by 40% with AI\n- First-time Fix Rate - improved from 75% to 92%\n- Planned vs Unplanned Maintenance Ratio - now at 80:20\n- Cost per Asset - reduced by 25%\n\nWe use Power BI dashboards to track these in real-time. Happy to share our dashboard template if interested.",

Recall Rate: (True Positives)/(True Positives + False Negatives)\n3. Lead Time: Average time between prediction and actual failure\n\nWe found that maintaining a precision rate above 85% while keeping a 2-week lead time works best for our operations.",

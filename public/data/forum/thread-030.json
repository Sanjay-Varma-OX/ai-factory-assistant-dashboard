  "content": "Hello fellow maintenance professionals,\n\nWe're developing a comprehensive TCO model for AI maintenance solutions. Looking to capture all cost components:\n\n1. Initial implementation costs\n2. Ongoing operational expenses\n3. Infrastructure requirements\n4. System upgrades and scaling\n5. Training and support costs\n\nKey questions:\n- What hidden costs should we consider?\n- How do you factor in system scalability?\n- What's your experience with maintenance contracts?\n- How do you budget for AI model retraining?\n\nAppreciate your insights!\n\nRegards,\nMichael",

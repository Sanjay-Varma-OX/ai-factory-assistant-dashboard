  "content": "Hello maintenance community,\n\nWe're revamping our condition-based monitoring program and looking for best practices. Our focus areas:\n\n1. Equipment condition parameters\n2. Monitoring frequency optimization\n3. Alert threshold setting\n4. Data analysis techniques\n5. Action plan development\n\nSpecific questions:\n- Which parameters are most reliable for different equipment types?\n- How do you determine optimal monitoring intervals?\n- What's your approach to setting alert thresholds?\n- How do you handle false positives?\n\nAppreciate your insights!",

  "content": "Hello maintenance community,\n\nWe're looking to implement predictive analytics for our commercial building HVAC systems. Our goals are to:\n\n1. Reduce energy consumption\n2. Optimize maintenance schedules\n3. Improve occupant comfort\n4. Predict equipment failures\n5. Balance system performance across zones\n\nWhat strategies and tools have worked well in your facilities? Particularly interested in:\n- Sensor placement recommendations\n- Key performance indicators\n- Data collection frequency\n- Integration with BMS\n\nAppreciate any insights from your experiences!",

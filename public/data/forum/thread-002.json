  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm looking for insights on implementing real-time monitoring in our food processing facility. We need to track:\n\n1. Temperature in processing zones (\u00b10.5\u00b0C precision)\n2. Humidity levels for product quality control\n3. Equipment performance metrics (OEE)\n4. Critical Control Points (CCPs) for HACCP compliance\n5. Production line throughput rates\n\nKey requirements:\n- FDA/FSMA compliance for data logging\n- Integration with existing MES system\n- Real-time alerts for deviation from specifications\n- Historical data analysis for trend identification\n- Mobile accessibility for shift supervisors\n\nWhat monitoring solutions have worked well in similar food processing environments? Particularly interested in experiences with wireless sensor networks and cloud-based analytics platforms.",

We'll definitely consider blockchain for audit trails.\n\n@Mark, LoRaWAN sounds promising - would love to learn more about your middleware solution.\n\n@Sarah, our current alert system is basic email/SMS. Planning to implement:\n1. Tiered alert levels\n2. Mobile app notifications\n3. Automated escalation after 15 minutes\n\n@James, great point about SPC. We're currently evaluating analytics platforms that support these capabilities.\n\nAdditional question: How do you handle sensor calibration and verification?",

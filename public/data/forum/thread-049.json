  "content": "Hi maintenance professionals,\n\nWe're implementing an automated maintenance scheduling system across our manufacturing plants. Key objectives:\n\n1. Resource optimization\n2. Workload balancing\n3. Priority-based scheduling\n4. Integration with predictive maintenance\n5. Compliance tracking\n\nLooking for advice on:\n- Scheduling algorithms\n- Resource allocation strategies\n- Integration approaches\n- Change management\n\nWhat strategies have worked in your facilities? Any lessons learned?\n\nThanks in advance!",

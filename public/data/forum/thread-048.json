  "content": "Hello maintenance community,\n\nWe're developing an AI system to predict equipment lifespan across our manufacturing facilities. Our goals:\n\n1. Accurate end-of-life predictions\n2. Early warning indicators\n3. Maintenance optimization\n4. Replacement planning\n5. Cost reduction\n\nKey challenges we're facing:\n- Data quality and quantity requirements\n- Model selection and validation\n- Integration with existing CMMS\n- Handling multiple equipment types\n\nWould appreciate insights on:\n- Successful implementation strategies\n- Preferred algorithms/approaches\n- Critical data points to track\n- Validation methodologies\n\nThanks for your expertise!",

Key findings:\n\n1. 92% accuracy in bearing failure prediction\n2. 3-week advance warning for critical equipment failures\n3. 45% reduction in unplanned downtime\n\nThe key was feature engineering - we combined vibration data, temperature readings, and power consumption metrics. For time-series data, we used rolling windows to capture temporal patterns.\n\nHave you considered using XGBoost? We found it particularly effective for handling imbalanced datasets (rare failure events).",

We have about 18 months of historical data, @Robert.\n\n@Sarah, the TCO perspective is valuable. We're leaning towards starting with Random Forest for quick wins while building our LSTM capabilities.\n\n@Emily, transfer learning sounds promising. Our validation strategy includes:\n1. Cross-validation on historical failures\n2. Parallel running with current maintenance schedules\n3. Phased deployment starting with non-critical equipment\n\nWould you recommend any specific validation metrics?",

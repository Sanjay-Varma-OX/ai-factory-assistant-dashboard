  "title": "Manufacturing: Balancing Production Demands with Maintenance Schedules",
  "content": "Running a high-volume manufacturing plant with just-in-time production creates constant tension between maintenance needs and production targets. We're struggling to balance:\n\n1. OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) targets\n2. Lean manufacturing principles\n3. TPM (Total Productive Maintenance) implementation\n4. Production line changeover times\n5. Preventive maintenance schedules\n6. Six Sigma quality standards\n\nKey challenges:\n- Minimizing production disruption\n- Meeting JIT delivery commitments\n- Maintaining TAKT time\n- Reducing Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)\n- Optimizing maintenance windows\n- Managing spare parts inventory\n\nLooking for insights from other manufacturing maintenance leaders on balancing these competing priorities while implementing AI-powered solutions.",

Suggests optimal maintenance windows with minimal impact\n3. Predicts maintenance duration based on historical data\n4. Automatically adjusts production schedule to accommodate maintenance\n\nResult: Increased OEE to 97% while reducing emergency repairs by 65%. The key was getting buy-in from both maintenance and production teams by showing them the data.",

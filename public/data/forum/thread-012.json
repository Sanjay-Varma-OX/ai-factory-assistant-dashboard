  "content": "Hello maintenance professionals,\n\nAs our facility moves towards AI-powered maintenance, data security has become a major concern. We need to ensure compliance while protecting sensitive operational data. Key areas we're looking at:\n\n1. Data encryption requirements for sensor data\n2. Access control protocols for AI systems\n3. Compliance with industry standards (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)\n4. Secure data sharing between maintenance teams\n\nWhat security measures have you implemented in your AI maintenance systems? Any pitfalls to avoid?",

Role-based access control (RBAC) for different maintenance teams\n3. Regular security audits of AI systems\n4. VPN requirements for remote access\n\nThe biggest challenge was balancing security with accessibility - technicians need quick access during emergencies.",

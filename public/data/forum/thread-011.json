  "content": "Hi everyone, I manage a small manufacturing unit with limited resources. We're interested in implementing predictive maintenance but concerned about the initial investment and complexity. Looking for practical advice on:\n\n1. Essential sensors and monitoring equipment\n2. Basic AI models to start with\n3. Cost-effective implementation strategies\n4. Training requirements for our small team\n\nHas anyone successfully implemented predictive maintenance in a similar setting?",

      "content": "Mike, I implemented a basic predictive maintenance system in our 50-person facility last year. Start with vibration sensors on critical equipment - they're relatively inexpensive ($200-500 each) and provide good early warning signs. We used Azure's basic ML services for analysis, which was surprisingly straightforward to set up.",

Resistance from experienced technicians\n2. Communication gaps between IT and maintenance teams\n3. Maintaining morale during the transition\n4. Balancing traditional skills with new AI requirements\n\nHow did you handle the human side of AI implementation? What strategies worked best for getting buy-in from veteran team members?",

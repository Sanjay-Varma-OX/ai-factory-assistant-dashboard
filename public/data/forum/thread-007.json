For harsh environments:\n   - Endress+Hauser sensors for temperature/pressure\n   - Emerson wireless vibration sensors\n   - Banner Engineering for proximity/level\n\n2. Battery optimization:\n   - Implemented dynamic sampling rates\n   - Used edge computing to reduce transmission\n   - Achieved 3+ years battery life\n\nCost was higher upfront but ROI in 14 months through reduced failures.",
